# Analysis.sh 
# This script is a wrapper around the readings-09.py module.
#
# The script takes as an input a file name, will run all 3 analysis possible
# in the readings scripts on the input file (min, mean and max).
#
#
#
# The script takes the following input:
# [1] output_folder: name of the folder in which to write the results
# [2] file_name: name of the file to analyse
# output:
# 	located in "file_name.output.txt" (created by this script)
#	contains in a single column the results from readings, all one after the other.


#get the input file name from input parameters


#create the output file (make sure it's empty, or empty it!)

# combine input file name with the output folder to get the place where to write the results.

#for each type of analysis, run the readings-09.py program
# redirect the output to the output file.


#Done!
